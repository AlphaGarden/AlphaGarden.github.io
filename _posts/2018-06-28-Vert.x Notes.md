#### Vert.x Core

***Golden Rule: Don't block the event loop.***

* Don't call us, we call you 
* In most cases Vert.x calls your handlers using a thread called anÂ **event loop**. 
* Verticles
* Asynchronous coordination
* Verticle is a bit like an actor in the Actor Model.(Different verticle communicate with each other by sending messages on the event bus.)
* The Context Object (Usually a context is an event-loop context and is tied to a specific event loop thread.)

#### Vert.x Web
