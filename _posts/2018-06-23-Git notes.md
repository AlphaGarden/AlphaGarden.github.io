##### What if we want to create a feature for the upstream repository and sychronize with upstream repository? 

1. We need to set up the upstream remote repo with the below command.

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream <upstream repo url>
   ```

2. Fetch the remote resource to local

3. ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   ```

4. Create a new local branch for the remote upstream resource

5. ```bash
   git checkout -b <new brach name> <remote>/<branchname>
   ```

6. Checkout to your working branch and merge with upstream 

7. ```
   git merge <new branch name>
   ```

##### Revise the most recent commit

We can use --amend option to repalce the most recent commitment with revised commitment.

```bash
git commit --amend -m <"Commit message">
```
